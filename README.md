An unofficial and community-maintained guide to Stremio.

This project is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Create a PR to the `main` branch. Once the PR has been reviewed and merged by our core collaborators, the changes will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
